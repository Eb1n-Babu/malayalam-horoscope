Malayalam Horoscope App
Overview
The Malayalam Horoscope App is a single-page React application built with Vite that delivers daily, weekly, or monthly horoscope predictions in Malayalam for all 12 zodiac signs (e.g., Medam, Edavam, Mithunam, Karkatakam). It presents horoscope data in a clean, responsive, and centered card-based layout, with each card displaying predictions for a specific zodiac sign, including insights on career, finance, relationships, and health. The app uses mock data (or a hypothetical API) for horoscope content, styled with custom CSS for a modern, user-friendly experience across devices. The API key (if applicable) is securely stored in a .env file.
This project is inspired by Malayalam astrology services like Clickastro and Manorama Online, which provide detailed horoscope predictions (നക്ഷത്ര ഫലം) based on Vedic astrology.
Features

Displays horoscope predictions in Malayalam for all 12 zodiac signs.
Presents data in a centered, scrollable feed with responsive cards.
Each card includes zodiac sign name, icon, and predictions (e.g., career, finance, relationships).
Uses environment variables to manage API keys (if an API is integrated).
Styled with CSS for a clean and modern UI.
Responsive design for mobile and desktop.

Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Vite
Dependencies: axios (for API requests, if used), react-icons (for zodiac icons)
Data Source: Mock data (JSON) or hypothetical horoscope API
Styling: Custom CSS
Environment: Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)

Prerequisites

Node.js and npm installed (v16 or higher recommended).
A valid API key for a horoscope service (if integrating a real API; not required for mock data).
Git for cloning the repository (optional).

Installation

Clone the Repository (or create a new project directory):
git clone <repository-url>
cd malayalam-horoscope-app

Alternatively, create a new Vite project:
npm create vite@latest malayalam-horoscope-app -- --template react
cd malayalam-horoscope-app


Install Dependencies:
npm install
npm install axios react-icons


Set Up Environment Variables (if using an API):

Create a .env file in the project root.
Add your API key (replace with actual key if using a real API):VITE_HOROSCOPE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here


Ensure .env is added to .gitignore:.env




Add Source Files:

Ensure src/App.jsx and src/App.css are set up (see project files or repository).
App.jsx fetches horoscope data (mock or API) and renders the feed.
App.css styles the app with a centered card layout.



Sample Code
Below is a sample App.jsx for reference (simplified, using mock data):
import { useState } from 'react';
import { FaStar } from 'react-icons/fa';
import './App.css';

function App() {
const [horoscopes] = useState([
{ sign: 'മേടം (Medam)', prediction: 'ഇന്ന് നിന്റെ കരിയറിൽ പുതിയ അവസരങ്ങൾ വരും.' },
{ sign: 'ഇടവം (Edavam)', prediction: 'സാമ്പത്തിക കാര്യങ്ങളിൽ ശ്രദ്ധ വേണം.' },
// Add more zodiac signs...
]);

return (
<div className="app">
<header className="header">
<FaStar className="icon" />
<h1>മലയാളം ജാതകം</h1>
</header>
<div className="feed">
{horoscopes.map((item, index) => (
<div key={index} className="horoscope-card">
<h2>{item.sign}</h2>
<p>{item.prediction}</p>
</div>
))}
</div>
</div>
);
}

export default App;

For a real API, replace the mock data with an axios call to a horoscope service.
Running the App

Start the Development Server:npm run dev


Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser to view the app.
Verify the horoscope feed loads with predictions for each zodiac sign. Check the console for errors if using an API.

Usage

The app displays a feed of horoscope predictions in Malayalam for each zodiac sign.
Each card shows the zodiac sign (e.g., മേടം, ഇടവം) and a brief prediction.
If using a real API, ensure the API key is valid and the service supports Malayalam output (e.g., Clickastro or AstroSage, if available).
For mock data, customize predictions in App.jsx to reflect daily, weekly, or monthly horoscopes.

Security Notes

If using an API, the key is stored in .env with the VITE_ prefix, making it accessible in client-side code. This is suitable for development but not secure for production, as the key is exposed in bundled JavaScript.
For production, consider a backend proxy (e.g., Node.js with Express) to hide the API key. Request additional documentation if needed.
When deploying, configure the API key in your hosting platform’s environment variables (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).

Deployment
To deploy the app:

Build the project:npm run build


Deploy the dist folder to a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
Set the VITE_HOROSCOPE_API_KEY environment variable in the hosting platform’s dashboard (if using an API).

Limitations

Data Source: Currently uses mock data. Real horoscope APIs (e.g., from Clickastro or AstroSage) may require paid access or custom integration not covered in free tiers.
Client-Side API Key: The .env approach exposes the key in client-side code. Use a backend proxy for production security.
Basic Features: The app displays a simple feed. Future enhancements could include selecting daily/weekly/monthly predictions or specific nakshatras.

Potential Enhancements

Integrate a real horoscope API (e.g., AstroSage or Clickastro, if available).
Add filters for daily, weekly, or monthly horoscopes.
Support nakshatra-based predictions (e.g., അശ്വതി, ഭരണി) as per Vedic astrology.
Include marriage compatibility (jathaka porutham) or bhava predictions.
Add skeleton loading states with react-loading-skeleton.

Troubleshooting

Feed Not Loading: If using an API, verify the key in .env and check rate limits. For mock data, ensure the data array in App.jsx is populated.
Styling Issues: Confirm App.css is linked correctly in App.jsx and no conflicting styles exist.
Language Support: Ensure Malayalam text renders correctly (use a font like Noto Serif Malayalam if needed).
